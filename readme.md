# 5oundation 5ive (F5)
5oundation 5ive is a NFT builder game in the metaverse inviroment, where people can build the most profitable buildings overtime and generate yield in the form of various currencies. 8,675 ETH will be raised with 75% of that ETH placed into the “Builders Treasury”. 

 

## Phase 1 - Meterial Purchase

The goal of F5 is to be the first to build as many of the available blueprints on as many of the available plots as possible. Using the available 5 blueprints, 5 tools, and 5 materials, a builder will set out to the open market to purchase any missing material pallets. All materials purchased on the market generate a 10% royalty with 50% off that kept by the team and 50% of that being added to the “Builders Treasury”. 

 

The first phase is the “Materials Phase”. Once owned, a builder can combine their blueprints, tools, and materials to receive a completed Foundation Building. Once received, they can place their Foundation Building on any of the available plots for free. Placement is important because profit multipliers ripple out from the center of the plot map. 

 

## Phase 2 - Building

The second phase is the “Building Phase” Once the map is filled beyond the 70% threshold, the town will begin to “come alive”. Using the Builders Treasury and the Town Governance System the Townspeople will vote on various no-risk yield generating mechanisms that the funds will be placed in, such as a single-coin ETH or USDC only yield farm (Planet Finance). Yield generated is sold into ETH and placed back into the Builders Treasury. 

## Phase 3 - Yielding

The third phase is the “Yield Phase”. All new yield generated is distributed through the town to each plot with a 1x-5x multiplier based on plot placement and building type. Being closest to the town center gives a 5x multiplier while being farthest from it gives you a 1x multiplier. This pertains to what percentage of each reward period is distributed to each holder in the form of F5 Tokens. If one building that has a 1x multiplier is receiving 1 F5 Token, then a building with a 5x multiplier is receiving 5 F5 Tokens. Each type of building is guaranteed a set percentage of rewards regardless of placement, but F5 Tokens will have distinct benefits for holders. 


House  6.67% in ETH5 Tokens 

Condo  13.33% in ETH5 Tokens 

Storefront 19.99% in ETH5 Tokens 

Office 26.65% in ETH5 Tokens 

Skyscraper 33.36% in ETH5 Tokens 
 

The Builders Treasury has an additional option. The option to sell your building to the treasury. Doing so will guarantee you 50% of the initial market value of the tools, materials, and blueprint of your 5oundation 5ive building. (I.E. a house would receive 1.00025 ETH back) The completed building is removed from the plot map and then placed back on the market at 110% value of initial retail price to be purchased by another interested buyer who can then place the building on an available map plot. If it is purchased, the entire amount is placed into the Builders Treasury. The new buyer now has the ability to sell their home back to treasury for 50% of the initial retail price again as well, not their purchase price. 
 

During the time between the sale and purchase, another Builder can use F5 Tokens to “relocate” their building to a new plot. The cost to relocate will be determined by the plot location and the open market. A auction will go live when the plot is freed beginning at the minimum plot threshold, and every player can then auction F5 Tokens to attempt to move their permitted zoned building there. (I.E. Houses can’t move to Skyscraper plots) The winner of the auction moves their building to the plot square and begins to generate F5 Tokens at a boosted rate. 

 
 

F5 Tokens have another distinct feature. The power to vote. While having a building is required to create a proposal, having F5 Tokens means the power to vote. F5 Holders can vote on any live proposals that are currently active for voting. Building owners will propose new yield generating mechanisms, while F5 holders will vote for them to be enacted or closed. A Town has a final line of defense against malicious proposals though, if 51% of the town votes to veto a proposal, regardless of F5 votes, the proposal will fail. 

 

There is another piece to these equations—the remaining materials and tools. With all good towns come goals of achieving optimum sustainability, and this of course comes with maintenance. To account for the potential lack of need for any further materials or tools, the system has incorporated an automated “city maintenance” feature. The Builders Treasury will use 10% of all generated rewards to place open bids for materials at 120% of initial retail value to be repurchased and repurposed by the City. This will go on until all materials are repurchased, or until the last bid has been placed by the system for the materials to be able to be sold to the system. This means that if a material is forgotten about, a bid will still be available for the holder at any time regardless if the system removes the 10% directed to repurposing materials. Once all materials have been repurchased, they will be burned from existence. 

 

 

## Phase 4 - Expansion

The final phase to 5oundation 5ive is the “Expansion Phase”. While F5 Holders can vote on what to do within the current city. The Builders themselves who own buildings can vote when to enter the “Expansion Phase”. The Expansion Phase enables use of a portion of the Treasury to deploy 5oundation 5ive on another network to build a secondary yield generated city. This is most useful when a network has good no-risk yield generating opportunities available. All yield generated from this new city is converted to the parent city and increases available yield for the parent city minus a fee established by the team. 



The close to 5oundation 5ive is the “Town Detonation”. In the event that the town decides to be closed, the Builders can vote to close the Treasury.  If the town is a Subsidiary Town, then 50% of the Treasury is distributed back to all building owners, and 50% is sent to the parent City. If the parent City is deciding to close down, then 85% is distributed to the builders and 15% is provided to the team as a closing fee.

Contracts to this will be: 

 

1. Material/Tool/Building Design and Custom NFT Contract to mint/create/build them. (NFT Contract should burn materials and change the use status of tools so they break eventually, additionally, it should combine NFT's and mint the building when it is time.) 

 

2. 3D Plot Map Contract that essentially "stakes" their building NFT onto a specific plot on the map and displays it on the map. It should then distribute to them F5 Tokens at a rate determined by the system. 

 

3. Governance Contract that reads addresses who stake and allows them to create proposals and reads their F5 balance to submit votes. 

 

4. BuilderTreasury Contract that manages the Ethereum securely and responds to governance proposals only. 

 

5. FundManager Contract that receives commands from the Governance Contract and also receives ETH from the BuilderTreasury Contract. It will interact with various yield farming platforms through API with the YieldManager Contract, and when not available, through a registered custodian. 

 

6. YieldManager Contract that receives yield from the various API Farms and distributes it appropriately to the land owners.
